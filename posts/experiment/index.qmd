Any successful experiment requires careful design beforehand. There are systematic methods for ensuring the validity of test results.

## Control Groups

To reduce variables in any type of experiment, it is recommended to include both positive and negative controls in the experimental design. _Negative controls_ are particular samples included in the experiment that are treated the same as all the others but are not expected to change from any variable in the experiment. The _positive control_ sample will show an expected result, helping the scientist understand that the experiment was performed properly.

## Statistics Significance

We do not want standalone samples for proving the assumptions: in practice we would aim for increasing the number of samples to improve te statistical significance of our results.
