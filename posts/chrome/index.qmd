When I bought a new laptop a few months ago, I decided to get a new Win10. Now the default browser on Win10 is Edge, which is built upon Google's Chromium kernel.
Things went well in the beginning. I compared the usage of Edge and Chrome, and found that the former consumes less memory than the latter, and the response times were both decent.
I chose to use Edge for most regular works, and added an extension for blocking ads.

Until 2 weeks ago, some weird things happened. Besides the default home page, Edge also opened another url which displays `traffic-pixel` in the beginning and quickly jumped to Google search engine.
WHen Edge was opened on the background, the new tag of Google will randomly pop out, which is really annoying.
I thought this might be a virus, even though a seemingly innocent one. However, I didn't find anything at all by searching in Google.
Then I switched to Bing, and changed a few keywords. The first result with a link to Reddit immediately caught my eye: there were some guys discussing about this 19 days ago!
Under their investigation, the culprit is the Edge extension AdBlocker! Indeed when I turned it off, the auto-generated new tag never come back again.
Apparently Google's engineers did some hack into this extension because AdBlocker targets at blocking ads on YouTube.

I should be more careful about using Chromium extensions, especially on Edge. The available choices are limited on the market.
Maybe the better choice is to install extensions from Chrome if I really want to.
