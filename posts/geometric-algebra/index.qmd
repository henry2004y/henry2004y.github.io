There is a Julia package called [Grassmann.jl](https://grassmann.crucialflow.com/dev/) for doing computational geometric algebra.

The [example](https://www.av8n.com/physics/maxwell-ga.htm) of writing Maxwell's equations in terms of geometric algebra
\\[
\nabla F = J
\\]
makes me wonder if this is a better way to solve Maxwell's equations numerically. I found one [thesis](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147561584.pdf) on this topic already.
