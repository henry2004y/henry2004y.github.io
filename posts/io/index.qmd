Data access speed is important. In many applications, it is more important to have faster data access speed than higher CPU frequency.

There are several new types of data storage hardwares, which are closer to the speed of RAM compared with the SATA HDD:

* SATA SSD: solid state drive, commonly seen nowadays on even PCs.
* NVMe SSD: a new protocol for flash media storage. 10x faster address seek time than SATA SSD.

Typical file transfer speeds: 
| HDD | SATA SSD  | NVMe SSD |
|-----|-----------|----------|
|200MBps| 550MBps | 3GBps |

Among the NVMe devices, Intel Optane is currently the most expensive one.
